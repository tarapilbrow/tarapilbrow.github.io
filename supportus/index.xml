      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tara Pilbrow Dance, like most arts organisations, is constantly striving to secure funding in order to reach audiences, engage communities and create new work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would welcome the opportunity to meet individuals and organisations that are interested in exploring ways to support the work of Tara Pilbrow Dance. We greatly appreciate donations at any level, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A £10 donation would allow us buy props and vital research material&lt;br /&gt;
A £100 donation would pay for one of our popular in-school workshops&lt;br /&gt;
A £1000 donation would enable us to spend one week in studio researching new work.&lt;/p&gt;
